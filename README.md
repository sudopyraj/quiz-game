# quiz-game
This is a beginner-friendly Python quiz game where users answer multiple-choice questions and receive a final score at the end.  I built this project to practice Python fundamentals like loops, conditionals, functions, and basic error handling.  It’s a small project, but it marks the start of my learning journey.
